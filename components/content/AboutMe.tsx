          A Delhi native and proud alumnus of Delhi University, graduating with
          a masters degree in Computer Science. I'm a software engineer with an
          insatiable creative appetite. At Upstox, I weave digital magic into
          reality, crafting seamless experiences across web and mobile platforms
          - because I believe great frontend development is where functionality
          meets imagination.

          When I'm not crafting code or diving into tech, you'll find me scoring
          goals on the soccer field or smashing birdies on the badminton court.
          I play sports like I debug â€“ with precision, strategy, and a love for
          the game. Whether it's a quick match or a full-on tournament, I'm
          always ready to sweat and outsmart the competition, on and off the
          screen.
